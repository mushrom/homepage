<p>
Many ages ago, in a time long forgotten, I had posted a post which foretold
the coming of another, greater blog post. One that would shake the foundations
of this blog and usher in a new age of Good Content. This promise brought
great hope to the disperate colonies desperate for Good Content, but
as the eons went by, rumors began to spread... Perhaps there was indeed no
Good Content to be found? Had there ever been Good Content to begin?
Worry crept over the lands, afraid that no such content would ever be created...
</p>

<p>Until now. Worry not, my friends, for that post is here. :O</p>

<p>
So, unlike my last post, I haven't done <i>anything</i> that I had intended to
do at the conclusion of the last post. I've gotten a bit sidetracked, but I
think the new direction I'm going in is better anyway.
</p>

<p>What's new:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Support for windows and android (!)
    <li>A continuous integration pipeline built on buildbot
    <li>New "wave function collapse" generator for tiled map generation
    <li>A spec parser and 3D tileset generator for aforementioned WFC
    <li>Vector image format, for smoothly scaling low-resolution vector graphics
        cheaply in shaders, ideal for text, logos, decals, etc. Very similar
        in principle to SDF textures.
    <li>Improved camera controllers, allowing for free rotation
    <li>Nanovg removed, replaced with nuklear
    <li>Graphics: adding MSAA antialiasing, dithering, and anisotropic filtering,
        tweaked shading a bit
    <li>More work on the ECS, now have player inventory, items and item pickups
    <li>At this point, most work is on the game itself, rather than the engine
</ul>

<h2>New map generation, new project? :O</h2>
<p>
The big news is that I've decided to put the previous 'landscape' thing on hold...
I still have plans for it, but I've decided to work on a 3D roguelike using
the wave function collapse library I wrote. This will feature winding mazes
with real-time action (not turn-based), clever enemies, complex object and
environment interactions, limited persistence between runs,
and maybe some environment destruction and crafting. This is essentially a
more focused version of what I'd been thinking of doing with my landscape thing,
and when I get back to that I think it'll naturally build off this project.
</p>

<p>
You might notice that I didn't make a ludum dare 48 post, and, well, this
was what I was planning to use as my entry, but the scope was (obviously)
faaaaar to big. Nonetheless I made good progress integrating the WFC library
into my engine that weekend.
</p>

<p>
Cool, you might say, but what's the big deal about this "wave function collapse"
thing anyway? Is there more to it than an over-the-top name? In essence, WFC
is a limited constraint solver, and using it for map generation like this
means you can generate complex random levels with guarantees about the
local layout of any particular tile.
(The <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">
original WFC implementation</a> describes itself as a program that
"[...]&nbsp;generates bitmaps that are locally similar to the input bitmap.")
</p>

<p>
It's particularly useful for generating interesting maps with very small
specifications. The above level is generated with only 6 models and
about ~100 lines of json. All that needs to be specified is the models,
valid rotations, and what neighbors a tile has (and their rotations).
Thus, the plan is to leverage this to generate lots of uniquely
themed, interesting levels with complex interactions,
with the time budget of solo indie dev.
</p>

<p>
Here's a snippet of what the json input specification looks like,
for illustration:
</p>

<div class="code_sample">
<!--: highlight json -->
{
	"models" : {
		"floor-tile-empty": "floor-tile-empty.gltf",
		"ext-corner": "ext-corner.gltf",
		"ext-wall": "base-wall.gltf",
		"ext-wall-light": "base-wall-light.gltf",
		"hall-wall": "hall-wall.gltf",
		"ext-hall-corner": "hall-corner.gltf"
	},

	"comment" : "left, up, right, down (0, 1, 2, 3)",

	"tiles" : [
		{
			"name" : "floor-tile-empty",
			"model" : "floor-tile-empty",
			"tags" : ["traversable", "floor"],
			"adjacent" : [
				[0, "floor-tile-empty", -1],
				[1, "floor-tile-empty", -1],
				[2, "floor-tile-empty", -1],
				[3, "floor-tile-empty", -1]
			],
			"rotations" : [0, 1, 2, 3],
			"weight" : 1
		},

		{
			"name" : "ext-corner",
			"model" : "ext-corner",
			"adjacent" : [
				[0, "ext-wall", 3],
				[3, "ext-wall", 0]
			],
			"rotations": [0, 1, 2, 3],
			"weight" : 1
		},

		{
			"name" : "ext-wall",
			"model" : "ext-wall",
			"adjacent" : [
				[1, "ext-wall", 0],
				[3, "ext-wall", 0],

				[0, "floor-tile-empty", -1]
			],
			"rotations": [0, 1, 2, 3],
			"weight" : 1
		},

        ...
	]
}
<!--: endhighlight --> 
</div>

<p>
Not too bad at all. A seperate "models" dictionary makes the tiling rules easily
skinnable, and the spec parser automatically sets adjacency rules for both
the declaring rule and the neighbor for all rotations, while checking for
inconsistent adjacency rules. (eg, "ext-wall" declares a neighbor
"floor-tile-empty", so "floor-tile-empty" gets an "ext-wall" neighbor as well,
a small improvement that makes specs a lot easier to write.)
</p>

<p>
There is one major problem, though: plain WFC only ensures /local/ constraints.
If you want to do something like, say, make sure there's a traversable path
between the entrance and exit, WFC by itself won't cut it. There's a few
options to solve this:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add another constraint layer, eg. Bad North (I've heard) has a
        navigation constraint on top of the regular local layer.
    <li>Generate first, and find or create paths needed afterwards, eg.
        in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1O0_yHe-6Y">Caves of Qud</a>
    <li>Add path constraints first, then generate around that.
</ul>

<p>
I've decided to go with the last, which is what the "tags" field above
is used for. Before generating with WFC, a simplified map is generated with
binary space partitioning, a very old-school technique. This map is then
used to determine where to place the entrance and exits, and the tiles in
the WFC generator are initialized with all of the "traversable" tiles being
possible. At the moment, this results in overly roomy rooms, but that should
be improved as I add stricter rules.

Animation showing some possible BSP map layouts

<p>
And that's where I'm at so far. Next steps include generating a
Dijkstra map for tiles and generating doors, puzzles and pickups based on that
and the BSP.

<h2>Vector textures</h2>
<p>
Inspired by SDF textures, this aims to have vector images that can
with multiple colors. It's not quite as flexible as SDF, more of an
experimental thing, but it mostly works and I'll probably end up
using it eventually.
I'll write a post about it in more detail at some point.

Sponza with all the new graphics features enabled, MSAA, anisotropic filtering,

<p>
So yup, that's all for now. Hopefully I'll be announcing an alpha of this game
soon, so stay tuned for that. :D
