<p>
After excitedly spamming a few (very understanding (mostly indifferent)) channels
with my progress on writing a 3D game engine from scratch, I decided that this
would be a good time to move my blog to a more proper place. So, here's
a digest of the progress I've made after about a week of working on
<a href="https://github.com/mushrom/grend">the engine</a>, complete
with neat videos. The engine is written in C++, using openGL as the graphics
backend and SDL2 for input and window management.

<div class="video_description">Spinning Cuboid</div>

<p>
I started out by following the excellent <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming">tutorial on wikibooks.</a> This was a good
introduction, I would recommend it if you're looking to start programming with
OpenGL too. Getting the first triangles on screen was 
surprisingly satisfying. This first video follows the tutorial pretty closely,
with the vertex shader passing a per-vertex color attribute to the fragment
shader. It's an interesting visualization of how the fragment shader
interpolates between the colors passed from the vertex shader.

<h2>Diffuse lighting and textures</h2>

<div class="video_description">Spinning Cuboid++</div>

<p>This video shows some progress after following the tutorials on texturing
and diffuse lighting. This already looks pretty neat in my humble opinion,
reminds me of old video games. Not coincidence, of course,
the simple geometry, per-vertex lighting and (lack of) texture filtering are
similar to what could be done in early 3D games.

<p>
Here I started to experiment a bit by drawing multiple objects.
This was pretty simple actually, at least a naive implementation. The code
binds an MVP matrix (model, view, projection) to the shader before
calling <code>glDrawElements()</code> to draw vertices by index. So, what if
we just update the &quot;M&quot; in there, and repeat
<code>glDrawElements()</code> for each object we want to draw? And this works,
but it's not terribly efficient as you increase the number of objects.
That being said, at the time of writing it runs fine on my netbook from 2009
with an atom n270, so it's probably not worth worrying about just yet.

<h2>Model loading and specular highlights</h2>

<div class="video_description">Also mipmapping</div>

<p>
After dutifully copying the specular highlight shader code, I worked on loading
multiple textures and <code>.obj</code> models. It was nice to see some geometry
more complicated than the familiar cuboid, as dear as it was. I was surprised at
just how simple the <code>.obj</code> file format is, it was pretty painless to
get working.</p>

<p>
However, contrary to the simplicity of the <code>.obj</code> format, drawing
multiple objects with different meshes was more involved than I had expected.
While with the cuboids I could just bind a new Model matrix and call it a day,
with multiple meshes you need to set up the proper buffer pointers before
<code>glDrawElement()</code>. When first approaching this I had thought that
this meant simply loading each mesh into it's own VBO (Vertex Buffer Object),
and swapping this out per-mesh. However, this would mean I'd have to re-link
the shaders every draw call, which is not great (read: absolutely terrible and
just horrible in general) for performance. Instead, the recommended way to do
this seems to be to have one VBO for each attribute, loading all of the meshes
and their attributes into this set of VBOs, and then using a VAO (Vertex
Array Object) for each mesh to keep track of what buffer pointers should
pointing where. This way you can simply bind the VAO corresponding to the mesh
you want to draw and then do a draw call, easy peasy, and pretty quick too.

<h2>Materials</h2>

<div class="video_description">Introducing creative commons RPG guy</div>

<p>
Now that I could load models into this little world, I felt the irresistable
urge to load as many things into it as I could. I ventured out to the interwebs
in search of worthy (free) models, and found these neat low-poly
models on <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/modular-terrain">OpenGameArt
</a>. The terrain objects came with material description files, which my little
object loader didn't handle yet. They follow the same format as the object
files, so adding support for them was straightforward. Now it can handle objects
with different material properties without touching the engine code at all.
</p>

<h2>More testing</h2>

    <source src="data/3d-vids/vid-6.webm">

<div class="video_description">Normals ain't normal</div>

<p>
Building out a basic test landscape with these new models, and hmm, something
isn't right here... The normals don't match where the faces are! This is
because the little loader had assumed that there would be duplicated vertices
and normals for each face, which isn't the case here. The simple fix is to just
duplicate vertices for each face declaration while loading. This increases the
number of vertices per model significatly (and so memory usage), but for now 
this works. 
</p>

<h2>Loading textures and normals</h2>

<div class="video_description">Much better</div>

<p>
After the fix mentioned above, and also loading textures from material files,
plus texture coordinates and normals from the object files. This looks fairly
presentable, maybe a low-poly cartoonish RPG would be a good first game demo...
</p>

<h2>Map editing, per-pixel lighting</h2>
<video controls>

<div class="video_description">Worst minecraft clone</div>

<p>
Most recently, I added a simple map editor and save format, and moved the
lighting to the fragment shader. While the cartoonish low-poly look is pretty
cool (and I can see why it's so popular among indie games), I want to have more
realistic lighting and textures as well, so the per-pixel lighting is in
anticipation for working on normal mapping and shadows. It also loads normal
and specular maps and passes them to the shader, although the shader doesn't
do anything with them just yet. The math for normal mapping is a tiny bit over
my head, so it might take a little while to get that working.
