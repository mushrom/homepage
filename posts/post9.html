Hello once again, my dear blog. The last few months have been very busy
between school, work, and projects, it's felt like a couple years by itself.
After a considerably longer break than I had hoped to take, I'm now back at
school, and have another successful semester down. The eternal
lockdown tedium is lifted at last, replaced by a strange alternate reality that
feels vaguely similar to life before the coronas.
The classes were very time intensive, so naturally the first thing to slip was
work on my engine, alas. After finishing the semester, I decided to revisit an
older project that I'd been working on, a Go AI based on monte carlo tree search
(MCTS), rather than getting back into gamedev stuff right away.
</p>

<p>
So, that's what's been up. Recently I've just finished an entry for Ludum
Dare 50, based on the cumulative work that's been done on my game so far.
My entry for this jam was
<a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/the-fight-scene">
    &quot;The Fight Scene&quot;
</a>
(source <a href="https://github.com/mushrom/ld50">here</a>)
, essentially a short tech demo showing off some of the improvements I've made.
The game is developed on the growing "template" project that is the game
I've been working on. So, definitely check it out if you're interested in seeing
the current state of things. Ignore the animations and light maps,
I'm a terrible artist, and needed to keep it small for the web. :P
Notable feature additions: per-character animation state, animations split
across multiple files (for reusability), particles that emulate physics,
some lighting fixes, etc. Not featured in the game is a raymarched fog shader.
</p>

<p>
With LD50 over, I plan to do some major overhauls of my engine, including
new, solid UI stuff, scripting (probably won't be done by the next jam),
adding a more flexible rendering pipeline, and so on. I also want to start doing
more frequent posts to get some buzz on the social medias, so I'll probably
start doing smaller, bite-sized demos and maybe some tutorials rather than
ad-hoc bi-yearly digests.
